# Social-Network
Social Network is a Golang based backend for the app where registered users can have wall of comments , subcomments and reactions

### Authentication mechanism
Authentication is done using JWT(JSON WEB-TOKEN). Only the registered users with valid token can access the API's otherwise content will not be accessible.

### Database Used 
* Postgres

## Prerequisite
* You should have Docker installed on your system. (Docker desktop for windows)

## Getting started

### * Setup the Database for your application

1. Pull the postgres image
```shell
docker pull postgres
```
2. Run the docker container with this image 
```shell
docker run --name postgres-db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -d postgres
```
> - here POSTGRES_PASSWORD is environment variable, this is the password for the "postgres" user created by default
> - postgres is running on port 5432 inside container, port mapping is done here to allow access from outside the container also.

3. Once container is up and running , you can use database visualizer tool like "DBeaver" to check if postgres is accessible.
> - Hostname will be the IP of your machine ,  Port will same as mentioned in docker run command
> - Username will be "postgres" if you are using default user.

### * Setup the application

1. Clone the repository into your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/ash3798/Social-Network.git
```
2. Navigate to Docker folder inside the repository .Here Dockerfile will be there which we will use to create container
3. Before building the docker file , clone the repository again inside Docker folder , using the same command as above.
> This workaround is needed to avoid entering the github access token in init.sh file which will be required to clone the repository inside container. So repository will be copied from here while building image .
4. After cloning repository in Docker folder , run the docker build command using Dockerfile present.
```
docker build . -t socialnetwork:latest
```
5. you can check the created image 
```
docker images

REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
socialnetwork   latest    a209a80aa593   7 seconds ago   880MB
```
6. Run the container using the image-id or name .
```
docker run --name Social-Network-app -e HOSTNAME=<host-ip> -e DATABASE_PORT=<db-port> -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password> -p 9999:9999 socialnetwork
```
> - Application runs on the port 9999 by default. It can be modified using "APP_PORT" environment variable , but then port also should be changed accordingly in -p argument of docker run command.
> - Database username and Database name have been set to "postgres" by default in application
> - If you are using custom user and custom database , you can set username with "DATABASE_USERNAME" and database name with "DATABASE_NAME" environment variables.
> - Additional environment variables that can be tweaked have been listed below.

7. Once container is up and running , application will be accessible on port number used in docker run command.

### * Environment Variables
* APP_PORT : Used to set port on which application runs
* HOSTNAME : Used to set the hostname of machine 
* DATABASE_PORT : Used to set port on which database is accessible
* DATABASE_USERNAME : Used to set username of database
* DATABASE_PASSWORD : Used to set password of database
* DATABASE_NAME : Used to set name of database
* ACCESS_SECRET : Used to set secret key to be used in generation of JWT Token
* TOKEN_EXPIRE_TIME_SEC : Used to set time in seconds after which token will expire. Default : "900"seconds

## USAGE TIPS :

### API available 
1) Create User
```json
POST   /createuser

Body :   {
          "username" : "testusername",
          "name" : "testname",

         }
```

2. Login
```json
POST   /login

Body :  {
          "username" : "testusername",
          "password" : "pass123"
        }
```
> In response to successful login you will get a JWT token , which you can use for accessing all other API's .Without valid token access will be denied.
```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2MjQ3MTc0MDMsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiYXNoIn0.vBO-kDDume2jvQTS7RhhlmyAvAew7bxLwxO5cpbFZFk"
}
```
> To use it , add the token string to the header of request like this :
```
{"Authorization" : "Bearer <token>" }
```

          "comment_id" : 2,
          "reaction" : "dislike"
        }

7. Generate Wall
```json
GET   /wall
```
> response will be in form of array of comments along with the count of reactions made on user's wall
```json
[
    {
        "comment_id": 2,
        "comment_text": "ash commented on nit",
        "sender_username": "ash",
        "timestamp": 1624710842,
        "reactions": {
            "dislike": 5
        }

    {
        "comment_id": 3,

        "sender_username": "ash",
        "timestamp": 1624710870,
        "reactions": {}
    },
    {
        "comment_id": 4,
        "comment_text": "ash subcommented",
        "sender_username": "ash",
        "timestamp": 1624710925,
